# Hello!, my name is Brian Salazar!
### Software Engineer focused in frontend development

I'm a professional software developer for almost five years.

Since I started working I have used frontend technologies that I have begun to love, I also worked six months as a fullstack using java with Sprintboot but I definitely liked the frontend more, I also used nodejs to do small backend jobs.

As a frontend I have mostly used vanilla javascript which has helped me to improve and learn more about javascript and its bases so that when I work with React or VUE the learning curve has been much lower than normal.
